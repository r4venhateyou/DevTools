            <p class="post-description">The lion is one of the big cats in the genus Panthera and a member of the family Felidae. It is muscular, deep-chested with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck, and round ears.</p>
            <p class="post-description">___</p>
            <p class="post-description">Lions live in prides of up to 15 individuals. The main responsibility of males is to defend the territory, while females care for the offspring and hunt. However, males are the first to satisfy their hunger after a successful hunt.</p>
            <p class="post-description">On average, male lions weigh 190 kg (almost 30 stones), while females weigh 126 kg (almost 20 stones). They need this weight and strength to hunt large prey and defend their pride.</p>

            <p class="post-meta">» Published on February 9, 2024</p>
            <p class="post-description">The elephant is the largest land animal. It has a long trunk used for breathing, lifting objects, and making sounds, as well as large, floppy ears that help to regulate its temperature.</p>
            <p class="post-description">___</p>
            <p class="post-description">Elephants have around 150,000 muscle units in their trunk. Their trunks are perhaps the most sensitive organ found in any mammal. Elephants use their trunks to suck up water to drink – it can contain up to 8 litres of water. They also use their trunks as a snorkel when swimming.</p>
            <p class="post-description">Elephant tusks are actually enlarged incisor teeth which first appear when elephants are around 2 years old. Tusks continue growing throughout their lives. Tusks are used to help with feeding - prising bark off trees or digging up roots - or as a defense when fighting.</p>
            <p class="post-description">But these beautiful tusks often cause elephants danger. They're made from ivory; a much desired object. Read on to find out why elephants are under threat.</p>

            <h2 class="post-title">Asian Rhinos</h2>
            <p class="post-meta">» Published on February 9, 2024</p>
            <p class="post-description">
                The Asian Rhino is a large mammal known for its distinctive horn(s) on its snout. It has a sturdy, stocky build and thick, folded skin. Asian Rhinos are herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses, leaves, and fruits. They have a prehensile upper lip that aids in grasping and pulling vegetation into their mouths. These rhinos typically inhabit dense forests and grasslands in various parts of Asia. Despite their massive size, Asian Rhinos are known for their gentle demeanor. However, when provoked or threatened, they can display aggressive behavior. Conservation efforts are crucial for their survival, as they are currently endangered due to habitat loss and poaching.</p>
            <p class="post-description">___</p>
            <p class="post-description">The greater one-horned rhino once roamed across most of Asia, but now it’s found mainly in India and Nepal. The last remaining population of Javan rhinos are now only found in one protected area, Ujung Kulon National Park on the island of Java. Sumatran rhinos are found in Sumatra, with a few individuals remaining in Kalimantan, Indonesia.</p>
            <p class="post-description">Rhinos have been around for millions of years and play a crucial role in their environment. They eat a lot of plants every day to meet their energy needs. So they are true landscape engineers.</p>
            <p class="post-description">For example, the greater one-horned rhino helps to keep the grasslands near rivers closely-cropped, which makes those areas attractive to smaller herbivores too. They also help disperse seeds in their poo, which help plants and trees spread.</p>

            <h2 class="post-title">The Snow Leopard</h2>
            <p class="post-meta">» Published on February 9, 2024</p>
            <p class="post-description">
                Snow leopards are solitary creatures, and skilful predators, able to kill prey up to three times their own weight in challenging terrain. The snow leopard has a beautiful, spotted coat, thick enough to insulate them from the cold. Their wide, fur-covered feet distribute their weight over soft snow.</p>
            <p class="post-description">___</p>
            <p class="post-description">Snow leopards are top predators in their environment, and their prey include mountain sheep and goats. Without the snow leopard, the ecological balance would be disrupted. For example, herbivore populations would increase, resulting in changes to the vegetation, also affecting other wildlife that live in these areas.</p>
            <p class="post-description">The same mountainous landscape also contributes to human wellbeing, locally and regionally. They provide natural resources upon which millions of people depend in addition to being headwaters for river systems that benefit over 2 billion of the world’s human population. So by protecting the snow leopard, we’re benefitting the whole natural environment in these areas and the people who rely on it.</p>
